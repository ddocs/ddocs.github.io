        <h2> Technical content with a human focus </h2>
        <p> There is often a gap between the language used by creators of technologically sophisticated products or processes and the end users who need to engage with them.</p>

        <p> This gap between technology and human understanding is one that I inhabit.</p>

        <p> Understanding the target audience whether they are end users, developers or engineers is paramount to creating content that engages and informs. Fusing skills in information technology, development and user experience, I am uniquely placed to meet your documentation needs.</p>

        <p> I am an experienced UX focused technical writer with a BSc Information Systems & Management, MA Medical Anthropology and a PGDip Psychology. I am also a Certified Trainer with a passion for lifelong learning.</p>

        <p> I bring a talent for documentation design merged with an understanding of how people think and feel.</p>
