<p>This project involved re-thinking the Developer Hub to more closely meet the needs of users 'in the field'. This involved creating a new structure, writing new content and re-designing the hub to improve the developer experience. </p>
<p> The intention was to meet the 3:30:3 rule - 3 seconds to understand the API, 30 seconds to find the endpoint, 3 minutes to be up and running.</p> 
<p>To this end, carefully designed graphics were used to enable swift and easeful understanding of the API flow. Typical use case scenarios were identified and documentation re-written to match these - hence enabling easy identification of the endpoint.</p> 
<p> Comprehensive but concise instructions accompanied by 'copy and paste' code was used to get developers up and running in the shortest time possible.  
</p>
<p> A measurable impact was assessed via web analytics and monitoring of related support tickets.</p>
