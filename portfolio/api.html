<p> This project involved re-thinking the Developer Hub to more closely meet needs and re-design to improve the developer experience. The intention was to meet the 3:30:3 rule - 3 seconds to understand the API, 30 seconds to find the endpoint, 3 minutes to be up and running. 
To this end, carefully designed graphics were used to enable swift and easeful understanding of the API flow. Typical use case scenarios were identified and documentation re-written to match these - hence enabling easy identification of the endpoint. Comprehensive but concise instructions accompanied by copy and paste code was used to get developers up and running in the shortest time possible.  
</p>
<p> Impact was assessed via web analytics and monitoring of related support tickets.</p>
