<p> This project brief involved producing a series of user manuals from a variety of sources including technical specifications and SME notes. These manuals were requested to accompany a global brand of medical labelling software.</p>

<p> Ongoing projects required updating and restructuring manuals in response to new software releases and additional functionality. With each new release, a new approach was taken to improve the usability of documentation. </p>

  <p> This project involved creating Installation and SDK documentation for a sophisticated interbank lending product. The sources for the content were documentation created by developers. This documentation needed to be revamped in order to meet the needs of implementation consultants.</p>

  <p> Work entailed collating all the existing information, organizing it, creating a consistent format and style and then rewriting the content. New staff needed to be able to use the documentation in order to assist with implementation under minimal supervision. </p>
