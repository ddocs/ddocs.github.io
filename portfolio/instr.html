<h3> AbilityNet </h3>

<h4> Tools used: Articulate </h4>
<p> This project involved designing an inclusive learning solution for volunteers to access a new helpdesk ticketing system. The solution was a series of interactive eLearning modules designed with accessibility in mind. People can be resistant or fearful of change so it was great to involve users in the process right from the beginning.</p>
<p> These conversations were crucial to enable the mapping of user scenarios and create chunks of learning that correlated to these. People don't necessarily want to know the nuts and bolts of a piece of software - but they do want to easily perform the tasks required for their work.</p>
<p> I used Articulate to create the videos and content with branding supplied by AbilityNet. This enabled AbilityNet volunteers to work effectively and efficiently with maximum benefit for service users and organisational resources.</p>
