<h3> Michell Instruments </h3>

<h4> Tools used: MadCap Flare, Snagit, Adobe Photoshop </h4>
<p> This project involved creating an application note for a Michell Instrument product.</p>

<p> I researched and wrote the content for the Ambient Wet Bulb Instrument in line with a brief. The copy was written to engage a specialist audience of engineers. This involved showing an understanding of their needs and an informed consideration of key issues. This was followed by a range of possible solutions using Michell instruments. The content was designed in MadCap Flare as a demonstration of how online access to application notes could look.</p>
