        <p>Sometimes, I meet with a client and it is very clear that they want me to write some specific documentation - but they themselves have zero interest in it. It is simply a check box exercise for them to fulfil some externally imposed requirement. There is an implicit message that no-one will read the manual.</p>

<h4 id="how-to-write-docs-people-will-read">How to write docs people will read</h4>

<p>In this kind of situation, it is important to remember that this kind of assumption does not underpin a helpful approach to documentation.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, by the time some users get to the documentation it is because all other attempts to solve the problem have failed. These other attempts may have included shouting at the screen, pressing all visible buttons repeatedly, or looking at cat videos.</p>

<p>Some of these attempts are super helpful in thinking about a documentation approach. For instance, make sure the docs are online as users often google the answer.</p>

<p>Historically, user assistance has been in the form of manuals comprised of reams of impenetrable text in a very small font size. Thankfully, those days really are over.</p>

<p>These few points are worth taking on board. I will return to these when I have more time.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Treat every page as page one</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think visual, auditory, kinaesthetic as well as reading</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Small chunks of information to ensure a manageable cognitive load</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Task based instructions that give people a sense of completion</p>
  </li>
</ol>
