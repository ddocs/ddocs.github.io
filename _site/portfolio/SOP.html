<h3> British Gypsum </h3>

<h4> Tools used: Microsoft Word, Snagit, Adobe Photoshop, Canon camera </h4>
<p> The project brief was to produce a comprehensive set of Standard Operating Procedures to accompany the entire production lifecycle of plaster boards at British Gypsum.</p>

<p>  The documentation was aimed at new workers to the production line. I worked with a management team of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to define best practices and to document procedures for every step of the production process from checking ingredients for particular plaster board combinations to final checking of plasterboards and troubleshooting. This initiative was part of British Gypsum's Total Quality Management program and has resulted in a decrease in costs due to damaged boards and improved board production efficiency. </p>

<p> The project process involved on-site documenting of the entire sequence of production by observation, taking photographs and interviewing SMEs to establish best practices. I then validated existing SOPs covering segments of the procedures updating and revising these as necessary. I created new SOPs in accordance with the best practices identified. The result was a comprehensive set of best practice Standard Operating Procedures to produce plasterboard.</p>

<h3> Drax Biomass Power Station </h3>

<h4> Tools used: Microsoft Word, Snagit, Adobe Photoshop </h4>
<p> This project involved working with a team of technical writers to create a documentation suite of Standard Operating Procedures to accompany the operation of a newly adapted Drax Biomass Power Plant.</p>

<p> My role involved writing SOPs for biomass conveyor belts. This involved identifying parts of equipment from engineering drawings and ensuring that the relevant components were included in writing to a standardised template. This included pre-start checks, running checks, operating instructions and maintenance schedules. </p>
