<h3>Next Generation Digital Printing</h3>

<h4> Tools used: Microsoft Word, Snagit, Adobe Photoshop </h4>

<p> This client had secured a significant contract and required end user manuals urgently to accompany the shipping of their product overseas. They could offer remote technical support but their client needed a world class user manual to accompany their state of the art digital printer.</p>

<p> On the initial visit, one of the team demonstrated their product to me. It was quite awesome. Mindful of the need for a speedy delivery, I took extensive notes of every step and asked lots of questions from the more general to the very specific. In addition to the photos I took, the team were able to supply me with further screenshots and diagrams a few days later.</p>

<p> I focused on the end users who would be engaging with this product, their level of knowledge and the chronological sequence of their interaction with the product. I created a task based manual designed for printing with plenty of graphics to minimise translation costs at a later date. I reviewed the final draft with a happy team before sending the final manuals well within the time limit.</p>
